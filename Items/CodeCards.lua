Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.\\nSee that? It's a little bit of magic.\\nThat's amazing. Why do we do that?\\nThat's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\\nCool.\\nI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?\\nCopy that visual.\\nWait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.\\nSay again? You're reporting a moving flower?\\nAffirmative.\\nThat was on the line!\\nThis is the coolest.

Drapes!\\nThat is diabolical.\\nIt's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.\\nWhat's number one? Star Wars?\\nNah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.\\nNo wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.\\nWhen I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.\\nThere's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.\\nI don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.\\nI predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.\\nWait! Stop!

She saved my life. I gotta say something.\\nAll right, here it goes.\\nNah.\\nWhat would I say?\\nI could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.\\nI can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.\\nOh, I can't do it. Come on!\\nNo. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.\\nHow should I start it? \\\"You like jazz?\\\" No, that's no good.\\nHere she comes! Speak, you fool!\\nHi!\\nI'm sorry.

But I don't recall going to bed.\\nWell, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.\\nThis is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!\\nI am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.\\nAnd if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.\\nThat was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.\\nYeah.\\nI'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!\\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\\nI'll leave now.\\nWait! How did you learn to do that?\\nWhat?\\nThe talking thing.\\nSame way you did, I guess. \\\"Mama, Dada, honey.\\\" You pick it up.\\nThat's very funny.\\nYeah.\\nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.\\nAnyway... Can I... get you something?\\nLike what?\\nI don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?\\nI don't want to put you out.\\nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\\nIt's just coffee.\\nI hate to impose.\\nDon't be ridiculous!\\nActually, I would love a cup.\\nHey, you want rum cake?\\nI shouldn't.\\nHave some.\\nNo, I can't.\\nCome on!\\nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\\nWhere?\\nThese stripes don't help.\\nYou look great!\\nI don't know if you know anything about fashion.\\nAre you all right?\\nNo.\\nHe's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.\\nHe finally gets there.\\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\\nThe wedding is on.\\nAnd he says, \\\"Watermelon?\\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\\\"\\nIs that a bee joke?\\nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\\nYeah, different.\\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\\nAbout work? I don't know.\\nI want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.\\nI know how you feel.\\nYou do?\\nSure.\\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\\nReally?\\nMy only interest is flowers.\\nOur new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.\\nAnyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?\\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\\nNo way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.\\nWhy do girls put rings on their toes?\\nWhy not?\\nIt's like putting a hat on your knee.\\nMaybe I'll try that.\\nYou all right, ma'am?\\nOh, yeah. Fine.\\nJust having two cups of coffee!\\nAnyway, this has been great.\\nThanks for the coffee.\\nYeah, it's no trouble.\\nSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.\\nAre you...?\\nCan I take a piece of this with me?\\nSure! Here, have a crumb.\\nThanks!\\nYeah.\\nAll right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.\\nOK, Barry.\\nAnd thank you so much again... for before.\\nOh, that? That was nothing.\\nWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...\\nThis can't possibly work.\\nHe's all set to go.\\nWe may as well try it.\\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\\nSounds amazing.\\nIt was amazing!\\nIt was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.\\nHumans! I can't believe you were with humans!\\nGiant, scary humans!\\nWhat were they like?\\nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\\nThey eat crazy giant things.\\nThey drive crazy.\\nDo they try and kill you, like on TV?\\nSome of them. But some of them don't.\\nHow'd you get back?\\nPoodle.\\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.\\nYou had your \\\"experience.\\\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.\\nWell...\\nWell?\\nWell, I met someone.\\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\\nA wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\\nNo, no, no, not a wasp.\\nSpider?\\nI'm not attracted to spiders.\\nI know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.\\nSo who is she?\\nShe's... human.\\nNo, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.\\nHer name's Vanessa.\\nOh, boy.\\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\\nWe're not dating.\\nYou're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!\\nShe saved my life! And she understands me.\\nThis is over!\\nEat this.\\nThis is not over! What was that?\\nThey call it a crumb.\\nIt was so stingin' stripey!\\nAnd that's not what they eat.\\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\\nYou know what a Cinnabon is?\\nNo.\\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...\\nSit down!\\n...really hot!\\nListen to me!\\nWe are not them! We're us.\\nThere's us and there's them!\\n\"), keys: [], span: Some(10..11)}}}"
